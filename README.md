# Slack status updater

This is a small [Bitbar](https://github.com/matryer/bitbar) plugin that displays your current Slack status on the MacOS toolbar and allows you to select a custom status from presets.

The script not only changes your status, but also enables Do not Disturb for the duration of your status.
